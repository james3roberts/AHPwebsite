                AHP Construction is a proud native of Colorado Springs. Our journey began in the late 1990s as a framing company,
                capitalizing on the constant activity driven by the city's military presence. This environment allowed us to
                become masters of our craft.Initially focusing on building tract homes and custom residences, we soon realized
                the potential to expand our expertise. This led us to venture into other trades, broadening our skill set and
                connecting with professionals who share our commitment to excellence.Over the past twenty-five years, we've
                assembled a dedicated team of specialists. From decks and siding to drywall and roofing, every aspect of our
                projects is handled by experts in their field. Our extended family includes professionals in HVAC, painting,
                electrical work, and landscaping.This network of professionals not only ensures the quality of our work but
                also provides us with a trusted resource for every aspect of our projects. At AHP Construction, we take pride
                in being your one-stop solution for all your construction needs.

                AHP Construction was born from a dream shared by a group of friends who grew up together in Colorado Springs.
                As kids, they spent countless hours building forts and treehouses, discovering their love for construction and
                creating something from nothing.Years later, as adults, they found themselves drawn back to their roots,
                eager to contribute to the growth and development of their hometown. They saw an opportunity to not only build
                structures but also to build communities and create lasting legacies.Their passion for craftsmanship and their
                deep connection to Colorado Springs drove them to establish AHP Construction. They envisioned a company that
                would not just erect buildings but also weave stories into the fabric of the city, each project a testament to
                their dedication to their craft and their love for their community.Today, AHP Construction stands as a testament
                to their vision, a company built on the values of integrity, quality, and community. With every project they
                undertake, they strive to honor their roots and build a better future for Colorado Springs and beyond.
